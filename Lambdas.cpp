  /*Lambda Syntax
    [capture clause] (parameters) -> return-type {body}
    Capture clauses : [=] : capture all of the variables from the enclosing scope by value
                      [&] : capture all of the variables from the enclosing scope by reference
                      [this] : capture all of the data members of the enclosing class
                      [var1, var2&] : captures each variables explicitly
    (parameters) : can be skiped if not required, but recommended to be used for clearity.
    -> return-type : can be skiped, and can be determined by compiler, but some compilers may not support this so it's recommended to use is explicitly.

    To invoke the lambda end with (parameters)
